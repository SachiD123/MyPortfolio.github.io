## **Credit risk prediction using machine learning methods**

## üöÄ **Overview**

This project explores the burrowers credit risk in loans and application of machine learning methods to predict credit risk of a loan applicant based on demographic and other characteristics.The technological advancements in machine learning has paved the way to utilise it in many areas of businesses. When credit lenders such as financial institutions lend money it essential to ensure the risk associate with the credit is minimized. Though there are solutions based on classical statistical models such as Logistic regression. This project aims to find a solution based on machine learning approaches. Machine learning models, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regression were used with logistic regression model to compare and analyse the accuracy of each model to classify the risk of default.
## **Data loading and Preprocessing**

A public dataset found in Kaggle was used, please click the link to download the data set.üìÅ[Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset) The size of the data set is approximately 32000 and comprised of 11 features.Data preprocessing methods used to handle missing values,duplicates and outlier handling. The outliers were visualised using boxplots for further analysis.

## **Exploratory analysis**

The cleaned and prepocessed data was explored to analyse and identify relationships among data. Insights and interconnections among data was explored further to understand the features effectively.

Further analysis was done using Power BI to enhance the understandability of the credit dataset.

##### üìåKey Insights
- Shorter credit histories correlate with higher default rates.
- Higher loan percentage relative to income leads to increased default risk.
- Renters and 'Other' homeownership types show the highest default rates.
- Higher interest rates are linked to lower loan grades, indicating riskier borrowers.

## **Methodology**
- Categorical data was normalised using one-hot encoding method.
- Multi-collinearity was checked as this dataset consist of a linear model. Based on the results final set of features were selected.
- Data was scaled to fit for the modelling.
- Data imbalances were corrected using balancing methods.
- Data was split in 80 % to 20 % ratio for the training and testing.

## **Models used**
##### Logistic Regression

A classification machine learning algorithm which can be used to predict a given class or not, by estimating the probality of event occuring. It uses the logistic funtion to transform the inputs into values ranging between 0 and
1 probability.
##### Decision Tree

A machine learning algorithm which is used for classification and regression tasks to make prediction based on a tree like structure. It includes a Root node the starting point of the problem,Branches the flow of the decisions, Internal nodes represents the decisions due to features in the model and Leaf nodes are the ends of the tree which are considered
as the final prediction of the model.
##### Random Forest 

A machine learning algorithm is model based on the Decision tree which combines a collection of decision trees to make prediction for classification and regression tasks. It is based on enesemble learning method where two or more machine learning models used to make accurate predictions. Randomly selected parts of the dataset is used to train each tree and use the averaged combine result to make predictions.
 
## **Evaluation and Results**

K-fold cross validation of five folds was used to evaluate models and Accuracy,precision and recall values were derived and compared.
  
| Model           | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.7610   | 0.7610    | 0.7610 |
| Decision Tree      | 0.9114   | 0.9158    | 0.9109 |
| Random Forest     | 0.9392   | 0.9419    | 0.9395 |

## **Optimization of models**

Randomised search grid was used with a five folds and a sample of 10000 datapoints and accuracy score was compared to find the best algorithm with efficient hyper-parameter combination. 

- Train set

| Model           | Accuracy |
|-----------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.7571000000000001|
| Decision Tree      |0.8018000000000001|
| Random Forest     |0.8413|

- Test set

| Model           | Accuracy |
|-----------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression |0.7541713014460512|
| Decision Tree      |0.7928000808979674|
| Random Forest     |0.8234401860653251|

Based on the optimization results the selected final model selected for deployment was Random Forest Algorithm.
